#  Bachelor's degree Thesis Project 
This repository is part of my Bachelor's degree Thesis project. 
The project was based on electronics, embedded systems and microcontrollers.
I made a autonomous robot using Arduino, Raspberry Pi and many Sesnors and Actuators.

# Purpose
The purpose of this Thesis project, was to be able to understand how embedded systems and microcontrollers are working.
Also to be able to programm the robot to autonomously wander around without colliding
