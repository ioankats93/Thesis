 while 1 : 
    ser.readline()




/*

The first argument – /dev/ttyACM0 is the name for the USB interface used. To find out the port name, we need to run this command in terminal without Arduino plugged in:

 ls /dev/tty*

Now plug in your Arduio and run the command again. If a new name appears, then this is the name of your port.

The second argument – 9600 is the baud rate and should match with what you set in the Arduino program.

You will need two hit enter twice after you type the last line  ( —> ser.readline() )
